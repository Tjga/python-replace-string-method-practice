## What this is 

this is my practice for using the .replace() method in python

## How it works

When you clone this to your computer and run it, the terminal is going 
to ask you to type a whatever you want in the terminal

its then going to ask for you to chose a letter you want to replace

then, its going to ask for what you want to replace the letter for

Finally, it will print the end result into the terminal
